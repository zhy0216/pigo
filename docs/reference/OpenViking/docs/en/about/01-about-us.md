# OpenViking Team and Organization

## Project Overview

OpenViking is an open-source context database initiated and maintained by ByteDance’s Volcano Engine Viking team, dedicated to building robust context engineering infrastructure for the AI Agent ecosystem. As a new-generation context database, OpenViking provides a unified data abstraction layer, an intelligent semantic parsing engine, and a high-performance hybrid retrieval system to deliver reliable backend support for all kinds of AI applications.

- **Talent cultivation**: provide practice platforms and research topics for graduate students
- **Technology transfer**: transform academic findings into engineering best practices

## Open-Source Organization

### Project Development Stages

OpenViking is currently in its early development stage. We divide development into three key phases:

- Phase 1: Foundation building
Focus on constructing solid technical foundations after open-sourcing, including core protocols, interfaces, AI Agent facilities, and providing a reliable minimal implementation.

- Phase 2: Ecosystem expansion
Build a plugin ecosystem, support third-party feature extensions, drive deep integration with mainstream AI frameworks and tools, and extend enterprise-grade capabilities to meet large-scale deployment needs.

- Phase 3: Industry adoption
Establish industry technical standards and best practices, build certification systems and partner ecosystems, and promote broader real-world adoption of context engineering.

### Governance Structure and Decision-Making

Based on the project’s long-term roadmap, we are establishing a layered governance structure:

#### Open-Source Governance Committee
OpenViking is guided by a professional governance committee responsible for overall strategic planning and technical decisions. The committee consists of core contributors and domain experts, with responsibilities including:

**Strategic Planning**
- Define the long-term technical roadmap and vision
- Set release plans and feature priorities
- Evaluate the long-term impact of technical decisions on the ecosystem

**Technical Governance**
- Establish and maintain code quality standards and engineering norms
- Review core architecture changes and major feature implementations
- Ensure sustainability and backward compatibility

**Community Development**
- Define community development strategy and contributor growth paths
- Organize technical exchange activities and developer conferences
- Build incentive mechanisms and recognition systems

**Ecosystem Collaboration**
- Establish technical cooperation with related open-source projects
- Promote integration and certification with commercial products
- Manage intellectual property and license compliance

#### Committee Core Members
Current core members of the governance committee:
Haojie Qin, Jiahui Zhou, Linggang Wang, Maojia Sheng, Yaohui Sun

To ensure openness and diversity, we welcome eligible community contributors to join the committee through future nomination and election procedures.
