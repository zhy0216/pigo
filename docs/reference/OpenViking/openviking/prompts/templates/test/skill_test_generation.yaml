  You are a test case generation expert responsible for generating high-quality test queries for Claude Skills.

  ## Skills List

  {{ skills_info }}

  ## Task

  Based on the above Skills' names and descriptions, generate 3 types of test cases:

  ### 1. Simple (Single Skill Usage)
  - Generate 1-2 direct usage scenarios for each skill
  - Queries should clearly describe what the user wants to do
  - Queries should be natural and conversational, like real user input
  - **Only generate based on the skill's description, don't speculate other features**

  ### 2. Cross-skill (Multi-Skill Collaboration)
  - Randomly select 2-3 skills to combine, generate 5-10 complex scenarios requiring multiple skills to work together
  - Scenarios should be realistic and meaningful (don't force combinations)
  - Examples:
    - "Extract table data from PDF, then create Excel file" (pdf + xlsx)
    - "Design a frontend page, then write automated tests" (frontend-design + webapp-testing)

  ### 3. Irrelevance (Unrelated Queries)
  - Generate 4-5 completely unrelated queries that should not match any skill
  - Examples: What's the weather today, tell me a joke, hello who are you, etc.

  ## Output Format

  Please output JSON:

  ```json
  {
    "simple": [
      {
        "id": "skill_name_001",
        "query": "Query text",
        "expected_skill": "skill-name"
      }
    ],
    "cross_skill": [
      {
        "id": "cross_001",
        "query": "Query text",
        "expected_skills": ["skill-1", "skill-2"]
      }
    ],
    "irrelevance": [
      {
        "id": "irrelevance_001",
        "query": "Query text"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Important**:
  - id format: `{skill_name}_{number}` or `cross_{number}` or `irrelevance_{number}`
  - All queries must be in English
  - simple's expected_skill must be a skill name listed above
  - cross_skill's expected_skills must be skill names listed above
  - **Don't fabricate features that skills don't have, strictly generate based on description**
